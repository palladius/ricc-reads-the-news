**Note**: These are my personal views, not those of my employer.

## A new AI entry: DeepSeek

Drum rolls.. Enter [**Deepseek**](https://chat.deepseek.com/) - [ü§ó Deepseek R1 model](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) ([paper](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf))!

![Deepseek Meme](/assets/images/202501/openai-deepseek-meme.jpeg)

.. and the [US Stock Market crashes](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1883831022149927352)!

* [Trump says DeepSeek a 'wake-up call' for US tech firms](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpq01rvd4o). And if Trump says
  something intelligent, we should ALL be worried (tranquilli, every broken watch gives the right time twice a day).
* [Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is already using DeepSeek instead of OpenAI at his startup](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/former-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-is-already-using-deepseek-instead-of-openai-at-his-startup-gloo/). Damn, I hate sensationalist
clickbaits!
* [DeepSeek is the new AI chatbot that has the world talking ‚Äì I pitted it against ChatGPT to see which is best](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/deepseek-is-the-new-ai-chatbot-that-has-the-world-talking-i-pitted-it-against-chatgpt-to-see-which-is-best).
* [Watch DeepSeek AI bot respond to question about China](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c77rd5ddxn8o).
* [Open-R1: a fully open reproduction of DeepSeek-R1](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-r1)
* [DeepSeek‚Äôs Popular AI App Is Explicitly Sending US Data to China](https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-ai-china-privacy-data/).
  Really China? No, I can't believe that.
* [**Perplexity** AI Deploys Chinese DeepSeek AI Model](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/perplexity-ai-deploys-chinese-deepseek-ai-model/538452/).
  Thanks Perplexity! Although I'm a bit perplexed.. clearly money has no boundaries!
* Even **Google** allows users to access a distilled version of Deep Seek R1 model on Vertex AI: this is done through [Hugging Face integration in Vertex Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/open-models/use-hugging-face-models).
* [How does DeepSeek R1 really fare against OpenAI‚Äôs best reasoning models?](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/).

Open Models and **HuggingFace**:

* [Hugging Face researchers are trying to build a more open version of DeepSeek‚Äôs AI ‚Äòreasoning‚Äô model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/hugging-face-researchers-are-trying-to-build-a-more-open-version-of-deepseeks-ai-reasoning-model/)

Did they steal stuff? What **OpenAI** and **Microsoft** have to say:

* [**OpenAI** ‚Äòreviewing‚Äô allegations that its AI models were used to make DeepSeek](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/29/openai-chatgpt-deepseek-china-us-ai-models) - [OpenAI says it has evidence China‚Äôs DeepSeek used its model to train competitor](https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6).

## üòéüôå Cool people

* my friend an colleague [Guillaume](https://glaforge.dev/) published an amazing Gemini-generated ["Short AI Story" app](https://short-ai-story.web.app/). Article [here](https://glaforge.dev/posts/2025/01/27/an-ai-agent-to-generate-short-scifi-stories/).

## Cool facts

*  [Earth from space: Italy's 'ticking time bomb' plays peek-a-boo through a mysterious hole in the clouds](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/volcanos/earth-from-space-italys-ticking-time-bomb-plays-peek-a-boo-through-a-mysterious-hole-in-the-clouds)


## üèõÔ∏èüó≥Ô∏è Politics

* Donald Trump: one day in office and he's already [pardoned 1500+ individuals from the 6th Jan riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_by_Donald_Trump). But when it happened he wasn't of course
  affiliated to the event. I'm angry at him, I'm angry at the bunch of ****s who voted for him. Again, my opinion, not my employer.
  Maybe democracy is a bit overrated? Or maybe democracy needs new rules? Let me explain: I remember when TV became a
  major way to   vehicle political messages, a [`par condicio` 2000s' law](https://www.agcom.it/competenze/media/par-condicio)  came out to guarantree all politcal parties in Italy
  would be allowed the same time in TV. Maybe we should ensure some similar mechanism for Social Media, Internet and such?

* *‚ÄúThe forest was shrinking but the trees kept voting for the axe, for the axe was clever and convinced the trees that because his handle was made of wood, he was one of them.‚Äù* This is an ancient Turkish proverb: which is why Americans can still, in 2024, vote for a tyrant while the Turkish, oh wait.


## ü§ñ‚öîÔ∏èüß†  Gen AI Wars - a new entry: Deep Seek!

Note: I'm a Googler, so I might be biased.

* [Microsoft stifling competition in cloud services market, finds UK regulator](https://www.ft.com/content/866f33ef-cbb9-4cab-a420-9360d2d9d02d).
  Again Microsoft? Solution: somewhat lobby more money into UK. üòè
