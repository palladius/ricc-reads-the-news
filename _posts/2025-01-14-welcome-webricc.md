## What does 2025 bring?

Welcome to 2025! This is the first year in quite a while which starts with ZERO good proposites.
As my friend Daniela said, child ask mum:
* Child: *Mum, what are yearly propositions?*
* Mum: *They are a weekly proposition*.

My only year proposition for 2025 is:

* work less. Good luck with it.
* run a full marathon. I'm done with Ironmen for a while.

## Gen AI

* RAG is so 2024!
* 2025 isd about agents, agents, agents! And something else, I'm pretty sure. Multimodal anyone?
