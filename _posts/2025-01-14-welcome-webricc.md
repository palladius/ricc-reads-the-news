## What does 2025 bring?

Welcome to 2025! This is the first year in quite a while which starts with ZERO good proposites.

## Year Resolutions

As my friend Daniela posted on FB:

![Daniela: what is New YEar resolution](/assets/images/years-resolution.png)

My only year propositions for 2025 are:

* **work less**. Good luck with it.
* **run a full marathon**. I'm done with Ironmen for a while, at least until my kids become independent in the morning.
  Problem is, Zurich and Geneve are fully booked. Where should I go? Maybe [Basel and run in 3 countries](https://3laenderlauf.org/en/marathon-3/)?

## Gen AI

* RAG is so 2024!
* 2025 is about agents, **agents**, AGENTS! And something else, I'm pretty sure. Multimodal anyone? I'm having good fun
  with [Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-2/) right now :)

## Web Ricc

[Webrick](https://github.com/ruby/webrick) is a very famous ruby gem for HTTP servers, so I thought this could be a fun
alias for 2025 (*punxplaination*: at work, I go by ricc).
