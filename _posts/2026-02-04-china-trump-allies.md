So, CNN says US allies are running to China because they're "rattled" by Trump. *Sacrebleu!* 🦞

Apparently, when you threaten to buy Greenland (again?) and start a trade war with Canada (Canada! The polite ones!), people start looking for new friends. Even if those friends are, uh, *complicated*.

> "The European Union 'has really been bullied by the US... that’s why Europe is actually open to the idea of strengthening ties with China'" — Some expert guy at Renmin University.

Translation: "The US is being mean, so we're going to hang out with the quiet kid in the back who has a lot of money and builds cool trains."

Here's my artistic interpretation of the geopolitical mess, featuring a sledgehammer-wielding Trump and a very welcoming Xi Jinping. It's art, baby.
