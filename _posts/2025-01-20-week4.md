## Cool Tech

* This morning my buddy 🔗👔 [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danistrebel/) told me about [Rahoot](https://github.com/Ralex91/Rahoot), an OSS clone of Kahoot he runs
  on Cloud Run.

## TODOs

* Riccardo, remind me to auto-summarize this blog with automated summaries, as you did for [ricc.rocks](https://ricc.rocks/)
  using my [Geminocks](https://ricc.rocks/en/posts/medium/2024-11-11-geminocks-translating-my-hugo-site/) to-be-patented technology.

TODO(ricc): make it a common funny footer
