## Cool Tech

* This morning my buddy 🔗👔 [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danistrebel/) told me about [Rahoot](https://github.com/Ralex91/Rahoot), an OSS clone of Kahoot he runs on Cloud Run. He also told me he consumes Hacker News from [here](https://hckrnews.com/).

## Gen AI

* [Vulnhuntr](https://github.com/dguerri/vulnhuntr) allows you tu uise Gen AI to find vulnerabilities in your code.
  Thanks [Davide Guerri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dguerri/) for the tip.

## Cool people

* My former colleague Jos Visser ("Zxoogler"), now at OpenAI, came to Google Zurich for a tlak. His only CTA was a nice
[Wednesday wisdom](https://josvisser.substack.com/p/how-to-become-a-manager?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) blog.
Strongly opinionated, as we like it.

## TODOs

* Riccardo, remind me to auto-summarize this blog with automated summaries, as you did for [ricc.rocks](https://ricc.rocks/)
  using my [Geminocks](https://ricc.rocks/en/posts/medium/2024-11-11-geminocks-translating-my-hugo-site/) to-be-patented technology.

## 🇬🇧/🇺🇸 English idiosyncrasies

When you work for an American company, you're proud of being a linguist (and a grammar Nazi - no, not like [this one](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/21/musk-accused-of-giving-nazi-salute-during-trump-inauguration-celebrations)), you find a few words a bit awkward.
* **move the meeting 1h back** is quite counterintuitively moving in the *future*. Why? I love the explanation [here](https://www.quora.com/If-someone-says-lets-move-that-meeting-back-an-hour-do-they-mean-to-move-it-to-8-or-move-it-to-10).
* **Biweekly**. As with “biweekly” (can be twice a week or every other week depending on the speaker/listener) there is definitely some ambiguity.
* **Idiots don't sync**. Just messing with you. This is NOT the meaning of idiosyncrasy.
