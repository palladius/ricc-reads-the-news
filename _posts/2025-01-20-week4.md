## Cool Tech

* This morning my buddy 🔗👔 [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danistrebel/) told me about [Rahoot](https://github.com/Ralex91/Rahoot), an OSS clone of Kahoot he runs on Cloud Run. He also told me he consumes Hacker News from [here](https://hckrnews.com/).

## Gen AI

* [Vulnhuntr](https://github.com/dguerri/vulnhuntr) allows you tu uise Gen AI to find vulnerabilities in your code.
  Thanks [Davide Guerri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dguerri/) for the tip.

## Cool people

* My former colleague Jos Visser ("Zxoogler"), now at OpenAI, came to Google Zurich for a tlak. His only CTA was a nice
[Wednesday wisdom](https://josvisser.substack.com/p/how-to-become-a-manager?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) blog.
Strongly opinionated, as we like it.

## TODOs

* Riccardo, remind me to auto-summarize this blog with automated summaries, as you did for [ricc.rocks](https://ricc.rocks/)
  using my [Geminocks](https://ricc.rocks/en/posts/medium/2024-11-11-geminocks-translating-my-hugo-site/) to-be-patented technology.
