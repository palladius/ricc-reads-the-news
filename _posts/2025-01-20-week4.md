subtitle: Tech, AI, and a dash of politics. Plus, Wardley Maps for the win! üó∫Ô∏è

description: >-
  From Rahoot clones to Gemini's flash thinking, this week's roundup is a whirlwind of tech news.  We've got OpenAI price hikes, Anthropic's bold predictions (AI surpassing humans by 2027?! ü§Ø), and even a linguistic head-scratcher or two. Plus, dive into the world of Wardley Maps and Gen AI vulnerability hunting. It's a wild ride! üé¢

## Cool Tech

* This morning my buddy üîóüëî [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danistrebel/) told me about [Rahoot](https://github.com/Ralex91/Rahoot), an OSS clone of Kahoot he runs on Cloud Run. He also told me he consumes Hacker News from [here](https://hckrnews.com/).
* Google stock ([GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) exceeded maxint this week (above 200$).
[Alphabet price target raised to $230 from $217 at BMO Capital](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-price-target-raised-230-131507813.html).  You might not care. I do.


## Cool people

* My former colleague Jos Visser ("Zxoogler"), now at OpenAI, came to Google Zurich for a talk. His only CTA was a nice
[Wednesday wisdom](https://josvisser.substack.com/p/how-to-become-a-manager?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) blog.
Strongly opinionated, as we like it.

* My former colleague Brian Grant doesn't need intros: he overlooked k8s expansion and execution, CRDs, surface, IaC and so on. He's basically a genius. I follow him on Medium through ITNEXT and I think he is one of the few to have ideas which can
take Terrafom/Pulumi/friends to the next level. Read more from him [here](https://itnext.io/packages-in-infrastructure-as-code-138fcf463880).

## Politics

* 22jan. [Elon Musk and Sam Altman take to social media to fight over Stargate](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/22/elon-musk-and-sam-altman-take-to-social-media-to-fight-over-stargate/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email). "Musk is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a U.S. government advisory commission recommending deep cuts to federal agencies. DOGE, first announced last year, was made more official Monday by President Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order ‚Äî but the commission faces a series of legal challenges." Now, the Italian equivalent DOGE ("[Ministero della semplificazione normativa](https://www.riformeistituzionali.gov.it/it/)") was introduced - if memory serves me - by Lega Nord and [Calderoli](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Calderoli) under Berlusconi. Which is to say, *The fruit doesn't fall very far away from the tree*.


## Gen AI Wars

Note: I'm a Googler, I might be biased.

Strangely enough, and probably nobody cares, but I concur. *Speaking at Journal House in Davos, Amodei said, "I don't know exactly when it'll come, I don't know if it'll be 2027. I think it's plausible it could be longer than that. I don't think it will be a whole bunch longer than that when AI systems are better than humans at almost everything. Better than almost all humans at almost everything. And then eventually better than all humans at everything, even robotics."* Dario, Davos to zurich is a 2h train. Come over, I'll buy you a coffee.

## üá¨üáß/üá∫üá∏ English idiosyncrasies

When you work for an American company, you're proud of being a linguist (and a grammar Nazi - no, not like [this one](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/21/musk-accused-of-giving-nazi-salute-during-trump-inauguration-celebrations)), you find a few words a bit awkward.
* **move the meeting 1h back** is quite counterintuitively moving in the *future*. Why? I love the explanation [here](https://www.quora.com/If-someone-says-lets-move-that-meeting-back-an-hour-do-they-mean-to-move-it-to-8-or-move-it-to-10).
* **Biweekly**. As with ‚Äúbiweekly‚Äù (can be twice a week or every other week depending on the speaker/listener) there is definitely some ambiguity.
* **Idiots don't sync**. Just messing with you. This is NOT the meaning of idiosyncrasy.

## ‚Äçüíº Strategy

* Ever heard of Simon [Wardley Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map)? If not check [his creator's **Blah** talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jCFVhnf2HE&t=137s). I was just talking to my friend [Steve McGhee](https://cloud.google.com/developers/advocates/steve-mcghee) with whom I was discussing about Wardley map for SRE/Reliability a few years ago.
Create your fake strategy [here](https://strategy-madlibs.herokuapp.com/) (on Heroku)!
I've started working on a Wardley Map or Ops and Agents in the Gen AI / LLM space.

## Gen AI

* [Vulnhuntr](https://github.com/dguerri/vulnhuntr) allows you tu use Gen AI to find vulnerabilities in your code.
  Thanks [Davide Guerri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dguerri/) for the tip.
