Wow, time for some little automation ;)

**TIL**: [Adding week number from bash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70226713/how-do-i-get-next-week-number-in-bash) (or as we call it *stackoverflowing*).

## Genius from Twitter tried 24 IDEs for us

* John Rush tried 24 IDEs for us: @SoftgenAI, Cursor, Wrapifai, Windsurf, and 20 more! Very nice and cool small videos attached.
    * On #9, with Replit, he pitches a real app which I used myself to check broken links in this website! [SEOBotAI Link Checker](https://seobotai.com/broken-link-checker-free/) and it finds a single broken link:

    * And it works!
