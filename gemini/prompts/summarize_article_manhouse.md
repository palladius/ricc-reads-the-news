Given this article I've just written, please give me two summaries:

1. a `title` 4-5 catchy words.
1. a `subtitle` summary, which should be 15 words max.
2. a `description` digest, which should be a short paragraph, say 50-60 words.

Make it serious, but do try to replicate Riccardo's humouristic style (and emojis if needed!).

Here is the Article in markdown format:
