🤷‍♂️ Yet another 💻 technology ✍️ Blog from a very 🇮🇹 opinionated Italian.

🗣️ On tech, 🏛️ politics, 友達 languages 👅 and 🤤 edibles.


* *What*: A weekly tech doc, similar to what my buddies Romin and Richard do.
* *Opinions*: my own.
* *Why*: **Why not?**. Jokes apart, [DORA](https://cloud.google.com/developers/dora) teaches me that it's easier and better to ship small and frequent.


## Code

* Code on github: [palladius/ricc-reads-the-news](https://github.com/palladius/ricc-reads-the-news)
* Published on: [ricc-reads-the-news.netlify.app](https://ricc-reads-the-news.netlify.app/)

## ✅ TODOs

* 🔴 Riccardo, remind me to auto-summarize this blog with automated summaries, as you did for [ricc.rocks](https://ricc.rocks/)
  using my [Geminocks](https://ricc.rocks/en/posts/medium/2024-11-11-geminocks-translating-my-hugo-site/) to-be-patented technology.
