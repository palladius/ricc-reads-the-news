# ricc-reads-the-news

A weekly, agile, newsletter where Riccardo tries to connect the dots with what's going on with Tech, and occasionally Politics and food.

## Builds

Currently, the site builds:

* 🟢 on netlify, perfectly
* 🔴 on github pages/actions, but its broken.

## Skins

Currently I'm using different skins by branch, but this is confusing for most (myself, github actions, netlify).

* Branch `main`: uses `jekflix`, cos its beautiful.
* Branch  `minima`: I backported to `minima` since Jekflix broke github actions. Funny news? Now it's broken too.
* `gh-pages`: can't remember.

Latest content, working images, and so on are in `main`, of course.
